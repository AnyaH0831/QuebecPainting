Quebec Painting
Media: Acrylic Painting on canvas. 

During the summer 2 years ago, I visited Quebec City for my 15th Birthday. My favourite part of my trip was my visit of Old Quebec City, specifically, Quartier Petit Champlain. It's a shopping mall consists of a few streets of stores. When I was taking a walk there, it calms me down. It was towards the end of August, I was sitting under the shade of the old trees, feeling the cool breeze and causing the leaves to create the shattering noises, while also listening to the calm music performed by the guitarist on the side of the street.  

This project is a painting of this summery scene, as I want to remember this beautiful and calming scene forever.
